1.1) DropOff(D), ParkingLot(Pl), PickUp(P), Connected(D, Pl), Connected(P,Pl), Car(C), Agent(A)

1.2) To keep track of the location of the agent or of a car, I can have a predicate “In” taking two arguments: the subject and the location. For example, I can have Car(C) and DropOff(D) and In(C, D) indicating a state where there’s a car C located in the drop-off point D. Or Agent(A) and ParkingLot(Pl) and In(A, Pl) indicating that the agent A is in the parking lot.

1.3) I can have the following predicates to describe the following states for a parked and delivered car respectively: Parked(C), Delivered(C), where C is a Car.

1.4) DropOff(D) and ParkingLot(Pl) and PickUp(P) and Connected(D, Pl) and Connected(Pl, P) and Car(C) and Agent(A) and In(C, D) and In(A, D) and (not Parked(C)) and (not Delivered(C)) ?????
	
1.5)
Action(Move(A, from, to),
PRECONDITION: In(A, from) and (Connected(to, from) or Connected(from, to)),
EFFECT: In(A, to)

1.6)
Action(Park(A, C, Pl)),
PRECONDITION: ParkingLot(Pl) and In(A, Pl) and In(C, Pl) and (not Parked(C)),
EFFECT: Parked(C))

1.7)
Action(Drive(A, C, from, to)),
PRECONDITION: In(A, from) and In(C, from) and (Connected(to, from) or Connected(from, to)),
EFFECT: In(A, to) and In(C, from) and (not Parked(C))

1.8) 
Action(Deliver(A, C, P)),
PRECONDITION: PickUp(P) and In(A, P) and In(C, P),
EFFECT: Delivered(C))


1.9)
The successor-state axiom solves the so-called frame problem. The frame problem refers to how effect axioms fail to state what remains unchanged as the result of an action.
There are formalisms that are based on the assumption that all that is not explicitly changed by an action remains unchanged, which effectively fixes the frame problem.
